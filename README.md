## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity researcher with a strong passion for **hardware hacking**, **application security**, and **physical access testing**. I specialize in bridging the gap between **digital** and **physical** security through hands-on experimentation, offensive research, and ethical testing.

My work includes everything from **reverse engineering NFC tech** to **testing ATM hardware**, **Wi-Fi exploitation**, and **developing & selling lockpicking tools** for educational purposes.

I **build**, **break**, and **Reverse Engineer** security with a goal: to make systems more secure through open research and responsible disclosure.

**I DIY Anything & Everything**
