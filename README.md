## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity researcher passionate about **hardware hacking**, **appsec**, **ATM physical testing**, and building my own tools — digital or physical. From **NFC fuzzing** to **Wi-Fi exploitation**, and even **custom lockpicking kits**, I reverse engineer and DIY everything I can get my hands on.

**I break stuff to understand it — then build it better.**

## 🔧 Areas of Focus

- 🛰️ **Wi-Fi & NFC Security** – ESP32/ESP8266-based tools, packet capture, relay & fuzzing attacks  
- 🧷 **Lockpicking & Toolmaking** – Fabricating custom red team tools (yes, I sell them)  
- 🏧 **ATM Hardware Testing** – Physical security assessments under legal scope  
- 🛡️ **Application Security** – Web/Mobile pentesting with Burp Suite, MobSF, Frida  
- 🔌 **Hardware Hacking** – DIY HID injectors, RF toys, SDR analysis, Arduino clusters
